# Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned about variable and expressions. I learned about boolean, float, integer, ause nd string variables. I learned how to use if statements, and how to print from them. I also learned how to put mathematical equations into python with an area. I then learned how to ask for an input and to work it into a program. I also may or may not have taught myself for loops and nested if statements. This is the most fun I've had programming.

This week I learned about the basics of coding. I learned about Variables and the storage of information on computers. I learned about print functions and what they do. I have learned about python and how to use it. I have also learned about programming languages and strings of code. Finally I have learned that I am able to understand coding basics far more than I believed I would.
