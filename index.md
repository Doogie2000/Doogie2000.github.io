# If Expressions and Lists 9/27/2018

This week and last week we learned about if statements and lists. If statements are basic programs that find the value of variables and run outcomes based on the values. i.e. if false : print("False") ; Lists are the next topic, and consist of making, editing, and using lists in a program. It stores more data for future use, and can be fairly complex. It helps coders create a data bank that they can draw information and variables from. I am enjoying coding, and hope to learn much more by the end of the year. 

# Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned about variable and expressions. I learned about boolean, float, integer, ause nd string variables. I learned how to use if statements, and how to print from them. I also learned how to put mathematical equations into python with an area. I then learned how to ask for an input and to work it into a program. I also may or may not have taught myself for loops and nested if statements. This is the most fun I've had programming.

# Intro 9/7/2018

This week I learned about the basics of coding. I learned about Variables and the storage of information on computers. I learned about print functions and what they do. I have learned about python and how to use it. I have also learned about programming languages and strings of code. Finally I have learned that I am able to understand coding basics far more than I believed I would.
