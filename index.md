# Reflection 9/7/2018

This week I learned about the basics of coding. I learned about Variables and the storage of information on computers. I learned about print functions and what they do. I have learned about python and how to use it. I have also learned about programming languages and strings of code. Finally I have learned that I am able to understand coding basics far more than I believed I would.
