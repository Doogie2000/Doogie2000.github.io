# Recursion 11/9/18

This week we learned recursion. It is an interesting way of working with functions that involves calling the function that's running while it's already running. For example, find() is a function that finds the lowest number, but in order to so if its the lowest number you use recursion and call find() while find() is still working. This can be a lot to take in, but I found that I could understand it well, and it should make coding a lot easier, by not making me use anymore loops. Class contniues to be fun and I continue to learn more and more. I can't wait to see what we will learn next week.

# Functions 11/2/18

This week we tackled the idea of functions. Functions are lines of code that can execute some task that is defined earlier in the code. Essentially they can remove the redundant code and instead just call a function. A couple examples are functions like print() and len(). They have been defined by Python, but we can define our own. This has been a bit of a challenge because functions can get very complicated if you're not carefull, but overall it has been fun and exciting and I hope I have the skill and ingenuity to finish the homework this week.

# While Loops/Scope 10/26/18

This week we learned about while loops and scope. While loops are loops that can run infinitelly until something changes and the value turns false, or true. This can result in an unending loop that can add to itself endlessly. We also learned about scope, which is how long a variable stays active. Scope can affect how you write your program by forcing you to set varaiables to zero, or create new variables. I continue to have a lot of fun in this class and I hope to include many more movie references in the rest of the year. Live long and prosper!

# Dictionaries 10/19/18

This week we tackled dictionaries. It is a challenging subject, and difficult to fully grasp, but overall it unlocks a lot of new possibilities for future code. The homework this week will prove to be challenging and I hope I can complete it sufficiently. Overall I continue to enjoy the class and I find that as each topic builds I am having a more in depth understanding of Python and coding.

# Loops pt. 2 10/12/18

This past week we learned specifically about for loops. We have learned how to create a recurring loop that solves complex problems and allows the user to search for several unique elements in one group of datum. This has been a lot of fun and continues to amaze me at how simple, yet complex coding really is. I hope to continue progressing as quickly as I have been, and learning as much as I have already learned.

# Loops pt. 1 10/5/18

This past week we have gone over loops, we started with a while(true) loop and are now progressing onto for loops. For loops will prove to be a very challenging lesson, but useful. I think these next few days will be not only informative but also a lot of fun. Overall, I am enjoying this class and learning a lot. I have understood the topics well so far, and I hope I will continue to understand and execute the homework for this class.

# If Expressions and Lists 9/27/2018

This week and last week we learned about if statements and lists. If statements are basic programs that find the value of variables and run outcomes based on the values. i.e. if false : print("False") ; Lists are the next topic, and consist of making, editing, and using lists in a program. It stores more data for future use, and can be fairly complex. It helps coders create a data bank that they can draw information and variables from. I am enjoying coding, and hope to learn much more by the end of the year.

# Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned about variable and expressions. I learned about boolean, float, integer, ause nd string variables. I learned how to use if statements, and how to print from them. I also learned how to put mathematical equations into python with an area. I then learned how to ask for an input and to work it into a program. I also may or may not have taught myself for loops and nested if statements. This is the most fun I've had programming.

# Intro 9/7/2018

This week I learned about the basics of coding. I learned about Variables and the storage of information on computers. I learned about print functions and what they do. I have learned about python and how to use it. I have also learned about programming languages and strings of code. Finally I have learned that I am able to understand coding basics far more than I believed I would.
