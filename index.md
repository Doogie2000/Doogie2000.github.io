# Loops pt. 2 10/12/18

This past week we learned specifically about for loops. We have learned how to create a recurring loop that solves complex problems and allows the user to search for several unique elements in one group of datum. This has been a lot of fun and continues to amaze me at how simple, yet complex coding really is. I hope to continue progressing as quickly as I have been, and learning as much as I have already learned.

# Loops pt. 1 10/5/18

This past week we have gone over loops, we started with a while(true) loop and are now progressing onto for loops. For loops will prove to be a very challenging lesson, but useful. I think these next few days will be not only informative but also a lot of fun. Overall, I am enjoying this class and learning a lot. I have understood the topics well so far, and I hope I will continue to understand and execute the homework for this class. 

# If Expressions and Lists 9/27/2018

This week and last week we learned about if statements and lists. If statements are basic programs that find the value of variables and run outcomes based on the values. i.e. if false : print("False") ; Lists are the next topic, and consist of making, editing, and using lists in a program. It stores more data for future use, and can be fairly complex. It helps coders create a data bank that they can draw information and variables from. I am enjoying coding, and hope to learn much more by the end of the year. 

# Variables, Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned about variable and expressions. I learned about boolean, float, integer, ause nd string variables. I learned how to use if statements, and how to print from them. I also learned how to put mathematical equations into python with an area. I then learned how to ask for an input and to work it into a program. I also may or may not have taught myself for loops and nested if statements. This is the most fun I've had programming.

# Intro 9/7/2018

This week I learned about the basics of coding. I learned about Variables and the storage of information on computers. I learned about print functions and what they do. I have learned about python and how to use it. I have also learned about programming languages and strings of code. Finally I have learned that I am able to understand coding basics far more than I believed I would.
